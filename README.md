I am Saasha, a Quantum Computing researcher and Computer Science engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Quantum Computing at the University of Victoria, BC Canada. My focus centers on exploring quantum machine learning algorithms for image processing.

I am actively engaged in open-source development, education, and outreach. I believe in contributing meaningfully to the quantum community as a Qiskit Advocate. I am also an ex-IBM Quantum intern and an NSERC CREATE Quantum BC Scholar.

I am writing my thesis on _Quantum Machine Learning_ and _Image Processing_. Here is the corresponding GitHub repository for more details: _[piQture](https://github.com/SaashaJoshi/quantum-image-processing)_.
