I am Saasha, a Computer Science Engineer and a Quantum Computing Researcher from India. 

I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. I am also an NSERC CREATE Quantum BC Scholar. My current focus is on exploring image processing applications with quantum machine learning algorithms and understanding the best quantum software development practices. 

I am, currently, writing my thesis on _Quantum Machine Learning for Image Processing_. Here is the corresponding GitHub repository for more details: _[piQture](https://github.com/SaashaJoshi/quantum-image-processing)_.
